# Stop Churning Content.<br>Start Building Authority.

As an expert coach or consultant, your time is your most valuable asset. You know you need to build your personal brand on platforms like LinkedIn, but the endless cycle of content creation is a drain on the very energy you need to serve your clients.

You're stuck between:
-   **Spending hours** every week brainstorming, writing, and editing posts.
-   **Hiring expensive agencies** that don't truly capture your unique voice.
-   **Posting generic content** that fails to connect with your high-value audience.

This is more than just a time-suck. It's an authenticity gap. The content you're putting out doesn't reflect the depth of your expertise, and it's not attracting the clients you're best equipped to help.

## You've got something to say. We make it easy to say it.

Your mind is filled with frameworks, client stories, and hard-won insights. You see the common mistakes in your industry and know exactly how to fix them. But translating that deep expertise into a steady stream of compelling content feels like a second job. Ideas get trapped in note apps, brilliant insights become half-finished drafts, and the sheer effort of writing, editing, and formatting for different platforms is overwhelming.

This isn't just writer's block; it's an impact bottleneck. Every unpublished idea is a missed opportunity to connect with a potential client, shape a conversation in your industry, or build your reputation as the go-to expert. Your authority remains locked away, while others with less substance but better content systems dominate the conversation.

Social Media Minion is your personal content-publishing system. We bridge the gap between your expertise and your audience. Our workflow is designed to take your core ideas—whether from a quick voice note, a client call, or a detailed article—and transform them into a library of powerful posts and articles. We handle the structure, the formatting, and the evaluation, so you can focus on what you do best: sharing your wisdom. Stop letting the process get in the way of your message.

## A Workflow Built for Experts

We've designed a suite of tools that mirrors the workflow of a professional content team, giving you complete control at a fraction of the cost.

### 1. Define Your Core Identity
Our **Persona Panel** is the heart of the Minion. You'll define your professional role, your target audience, and—most importantly—provide your core knowledge. Paste in your book chapters, foundational frameworks, and articles to create a "Reference World" the AI uses as its source of truth.

### 2. Generate Posts, Not Just Words
Stop staring at a blank page. Provide a source article (yours or someone else's), and the Minion will use your custom **Template Library** to generate a dozen unique, high-quality posts. It then scores each one, so you can immediately see which posts are most likely to resonate.

### 3. A Professional Article Workflow
Go from a fleeting idea to a polished, 2000-word thought leadership piece without the friction.
-   **Generate Ideas:** The AI analyzes a source to brainstorm new, relevant article ideas tailored to your audience.
-   **Craft Headlines:** Get 10 powerful, evaluated headline options to ensure your article gets clicked.
-   **Iterative Enhancement:** The AI drafts your article, then evaluates its own work and provides a checklist of suggestions. You choose which to apply, and the AI rewrites, getting closer to perfection with each loop.

### 4. Schedule and Automate
Connect your Ayrshare account to load your approved posts into a queue and schedule them to go out at the optimal times. The entire process, from idea to published post, is streamlined and under your control.
